# GoatSwitch AI Code Migration
Migrating code with GoatSwitch is a safe, guided process.
Every .Net project, defined by a ".csproj"-file is migrated separately. That means you have to start at a csproj with no dependencies on other local projects and work your way up until the full soltuion is migrated.
# Migration Steps
## Step 1: Test generation
Generating unit tests first enables a safe migration process
## Step 2: Code Translation
AI translation allows the migrated code to use modern features
## Step 3: Code Verification
Verification ensures your code still functions just as before
## (Optional) Step 4: Improvement
After migration GoatSwitch can be used to make smaller improvements like adding comments or changing libraries
